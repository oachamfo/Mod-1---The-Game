#About Project
    ##Title
    DOM manipulations can create interactive GUI applications and games using JavaScript.
    This game demonstrates manipulation of the DOM and how DOM manipulation is used in JavaScript game development.
    
    ##Motivation
    This project was built as a requirement for a PerScholas software engineering cohort.
    Students were give a week for completion. Per project specifications, game had to meet
    the following:
        1. Be two player: either player and computer or two manual players
        2. Have a win state
        3. Have a lose state
        4. A way to keep playing until the game is over
        5. Mutiple rounds   
    The motivation is the application of DOM manipulation using JavaScript
    to make an interactive game that aims to improve acquisition 
    of second language vocabulary through the use of matching pictures to written text. 
    Players take turn. In each turn, a player clicks on two cards. 
    The order in which the cards are clicked, whether picture first or written text first 
    is irrelevant. If the two cards the player clicked match, the player scores points.
    If a player does not get a match, the player gets a strike. The maximum number of strikes is by default three. After a player clicks on all cards or a player strikes out, whichever comes first, the next player takes turn. A round is completed when all players have taken a turn. The player with the most points after three rounds wins the game. All other players lose. Although the game is by default two players,
    the code is written so that it can be scaled to add more players by adding players to the array of players.
