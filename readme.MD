#About Project
    ##Title
    DOM manipulations can create interactive GUI applications and games using JavaScript.
    This game demonstrates manipulation of the DOM and how DOM manipulation is used in JavaScript game development.
    
    ##Motivation
    This project was built as a requirement for a PerScholas software engineering cohort.
    Students were give a week for completion. Per project specifications, game had to meet
    the following:
        1. Be two player: either player and computer or two manual players
        2. Have a win state
        3. Have a lose state
        4. A way to keep playing until the game is over
        5. Mutiple rounds   
    The motivation is the application of DOM manipulation using JavaScript
    to make an interactive game that aims to improve acquisition 
    of second language vocabulary through the use of matching pictures to written text. 
    Players take a turn. In each turn, a player clicks on two cards. 
    To win a round, a player needs a card with a picture and a 
    corresponding card with written text. The order in which the 
    cards are selected, whether picture first or written text first 
    is irrelevant. If a player does not get a match, the other player 
    makes an attempt. The cycle continues until a player wins a round. 
    Points will be awarded for winning a round. The player with the most points 
    after three rounds wins the game.
